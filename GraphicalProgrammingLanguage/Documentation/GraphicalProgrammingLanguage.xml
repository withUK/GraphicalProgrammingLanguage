            The command parser is used to take the input from the user and ascertains whether it matches syntax patterns 
            to draw out the command name and variables. When a command has the required parameters the parser executes and
            logs the action as successful.
            The MainGUI is passed within the constructor to ensure the GUI elements are available for access dependant on
            the command.
